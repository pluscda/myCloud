# AMPOS Technical Hands-on - Web
- The project is based on Vue 2.6, Vuex, and Vue Router.
- The port, 13888, must be free when running npm run serve.
- The AJAX API in the demo is based on https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
- Each page can contain the max number of 45 news.
- If you get the codes from gitHub, the 2 files insides the https://github.com/pluscda/ampos2/tree/demo/src/views/common, need to be renamed to Header.vue and Footer.vue before running the npm run serve.
